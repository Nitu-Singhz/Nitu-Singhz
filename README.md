## Hi there

Hi, I'm [Nitu Singh](https://github.com/Nitu-Singhz)

🎓 BCA student | Curious learner | Tech enthusiast  

I’m someone who learns by asking questions, breaking concepts down, and connecting theory with real-world use.

  Strengthening my programming fundamentals and building small academic + personal projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
  Python, Java (core concepts), Data Science basics, and Computer Science fundamentals.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
  Beginner-friendly projects, college assignments, and learning-based repositories where I can grow with others.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with  
  Writing clean code, understanding real-world use cases, and improving problem-solving skills.

- 💬 Ask me about  
  Python basics, Java fundamentals, data structures (beginner level), CS theory, or how I learn concepts step-by-step.
